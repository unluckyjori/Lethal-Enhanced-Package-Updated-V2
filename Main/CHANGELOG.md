# Changelog for Version 10.0.0

### Updates
- Updated mods
- Updated readme
- v70 compatibility
- Removed changelog button from main menu
- Removed a lot of mods that don't fit with Lethal Company. The reason for this is, I feel that as I continued development of this modpack, I lost sight of the main vision, to make Lethal Company more enhanced. Over the updates, I've been adding mods that don't really fit in Lethal Company and were just for fun. For example, take Ship Windows. Ship Windows is a great and cool mod, but it has one flaw-the ship windows open up the ship and remove the feeling of being cramped in there. One of the reasons Lethal Company is great is because you feel like you are underpaid, working for a corporation that does not care about you and takes the cheapest option, like having no windows in a spaceship. Another thing that has not been good was the enemies. Most enemies don't fit the Lethal Company feeling, like the giant Mario enemy, this is not at all similar to the other enemies. Of course, I will still keep the OG enemies like Herobrine, Football, and Immortal Snail, but some I have removed. I hope you like these new changes I have made, and feedback is greatly appreciated.
