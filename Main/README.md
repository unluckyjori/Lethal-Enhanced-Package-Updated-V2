# Cosmic Logbook
**<details><summary> Click to Expand**

</summary>

# __SECTOR: Orchard__ 
- **Experimentation** — ▮0 
> - Experimentation is an abandoned industrialized moon. It features rough landscapes and dead soil. Various old machinery and decaying structures can be found all around the moon. In front of the main entrance is a train track and an old train stretching across the whole moon. Due to the elevation of the plateau the train track is built on, it serves as a great escape spot from enemies and floods, as neither can reach it.

- **Assurance** — ▮0 
> - Assurance is a desert moon. It has a lot of steep hills and monstrous rocks. Like on Experimentation and Offense, abandoned machinery can be found scattered around the map, indicating that there once was some kind of industry present on this moon.

- **Vow** — ▮0 
> - Assurance is a desert moon. It has a lot of steep hills and monstrous rocks. Like on Experimentation and Offense, abandoned machinery can be found scattered around the map, indicating that there once was some kind of industry present on this moon.

- **Offense** — ▮0 
> - Offense shares many similarities with Assurance. They are both similar in appearance and the weather they support. Offense has a larger map with more machinery scattered around. This could indicate that the industry on this moon was once thriving. It is uncertain, though, what kind of industry such a crude environment could provide.

- **March** — ▮0 
> - Much like Vow, March has a lush forest landscape. It does not support rainy weather but instead is under constant rain, most likely due to its moisture-saturated atmosphere. Quicksand spots on March are always in the same locations instead of spawning randomly like on Vow. March's terrain is rather hilly, and a bunch of trees are scattered all around the map.

- **Adamance** — ▮0 
> - Adamance has a large valley between the main entrance and the ship, as well as a lot of steep slopes. Traversing the valley is quite time-consuming and gets dangerous later in the day when monsters start to spawn, like Baboon Hawks and Forest Keepers, which can spot you from very far away or block a path. The moon has a lot of shortcuts to avoid these and make transferring scrap a lot safer.

- **Rend** — ▮550
> - Rend's exterior sports numerous dead-trees, rocks, and hills, with large sections of map that employees will never need to traverse. The map is surrounded by numerous large drop-offs that will kill the player if they happen to fall into them, with similar cliffs spotted around the map; however, a shallower hole located near the largest hill will lead to the moon's only fire exit. From exiting the ship, a series of lamps connected by a swaying rope will lead employees to the main entrance, with a small cottage located at around the halfway point of this trail.

- **Dine** — ▮600 
> - Dine has many large protrusions on its surface that are decorated with rocks and trees. The ground has darker areas, most likely a pseudo-path, that could be mistaken for quicksand if the moon were to be rainy. There are a dangerous number of cliffs and holes that will either kill or trap employees; if trapped in a hole, an Extension Ladder or a Teleporter could be used to escape. Near the center of the map, there is a pipe that protrudes from the ground and follows a chain-link fence before both of them disappear into a nearby hill.

- **Titan** — ▮700 
> - Titan is a moon in Lethal Company and has a difficulty rating of Hard. It is a difficult but very lucrative moon. While the outside is very small, Outdoor entities start spawning earlier on this moon. However, due to it consistently spawning a massive 30 scrap parts and its huge loot table, this moon is very popular among employees who are willing to take a risk for a generous paycheck.

- **Artifice** — ▮1500 
> - Artifice is a strangely empty and eerie moon. Everything around looks decayed and abandoned. Employees will descend upon a fenced-in complex with four garages being dominating within the fenceline. Each garage is different than the last, having different interior aspects. They all have large bay doors that can be operated by a switch inside.

- **Embrion** — ▮150
> - Embrion is a desolate, abandoned moon with enormous rocks littering its surface, many of which reach high into the sky. Aside from these rocks, though, the landscape is barren and empty. The moon's surface is pure amethyst, giving your footsteps a crunchy sound as you walk. The lack of other life, vegetation, or sound present outside gives the moon an eerie atmosphere.

# __SECTOR: Briar__ 
- **Maritopia** — ▮0 
> - Maritopia was once a bustling hub of civilization until rising sea levels claimed it, leaving only echoes of its former glory.

- **Landslide** — ▮0
> - A large and open swamp.

- **Divide** — ▮0
> - A mountainous snowy moon.

- **Solace** — ▮0 
> - Normally tranquil, extreme weather has recently become more common. Abandoned, yet a large villa still stands. The company has received reports of both large and small dogs.

- **IceBound** — ▮0 
> - An easy tier moon with a frozen lake surrounded by mountains.

- **Arcadia** — ▮125
> - Varied introduced species, some showing signs of rapid evolution.

- **Incalescense** — ▮150
> - Decaying water treatment facility on a moon suffering from sudden, extreme heat caused by pollution.

- **Triskelion** — ▮350 
> - A deteriorating mining platform situated above a gas giant.

- **Nimbus** — ▮360
> - Nimbus is an enigmatic flying island, detached from its home moon. Its origins and nature remain shrouded in mystery. The history of Nimbus is unknown, its existence a puzzling anomaly in the cosmos.

- **Orion** — ▮750
> - The church structure may exhibit compromised integrity, necessitating cautious exploration. Dim lighting within the church may impede operations, requiring specialized visibility aids. Reports suggest the presence of individuals, taken over by a mysterious mask, posing an unforeseen threat during scrap retrieval.

- **Auralis** — ▮850
> - A large facility nestled within the mountains that once mass-produced general goods. Its true function was to act as a facade for the Company's ethically questionable experiments. Surviving salvage teams have reported that the facility seems to shift each day, as if in constant flux.

-  ᔑ リ 𝙹 ᒲ ᔑ ꖎ || — ▮???? 
> - DATA CORRUPTED

# __SECTOR: Mortis__ 
- **Aquatis** — ▮0 
> - Aquatis, primarily a water moon with scattered islands, offers a relatively safe environment compared to other company-issued landing locations. The island features greenery in the form of bushes and palm trees. A beached ship and hatches around the island mark points of interest for exploration.

- **Collateral** — ▮0 
> - An easy tier moon with hoarding bugs and outdoor scrap.

- **Hydro** — ▮0 
> - A mid to late tier forest marsh like moon. Fits around the three intermediate moons.

- **Azure** — ▮0 
> - Azure resembles an ancient Aztec civilization, with weathered temples and intricate carvings.

- **Egypt** — ▮60 
> - The moon exterior does not spawn giants or trees. Desert worms and spiders are much more likely to spawn on this moon. Lethal Company uses weighted spawns, so increased weight does not mean guaranteed chances.

- **Submersion** — ▮250
> - A flooded moon that requires you to find levers to get to the main entrance.

- **Integrity** — ▮250 
> - A red mesa moon.

- **Synthesis** — ▮300
> - Synthesis is an intriguing moon with lush, Earth-like landscapes featuring verdant forests and varied topography. The dynamic terrain includes numerous holes and unstable ground, making exploration treacherous, especially when crossing the perilous, breakable bridge. Adventurers must also contend with diverse enemies, including the formidable Old Bird, while accessing a mysterious facility via an elevator.

- **PsychSanctum** — ▮340
> - PsychSanctum was once a place of refuge for the mentally ill, a sanctuary where they could seek solace from a world that had cast them aside. But as the years passed, it became a prison, its patients subjected to cruel treatments in the name of science.

- **Corrosion** — ▮550
> - A moon covered in acid.

- **Vertigo** — ▮600
> - A moon covered in acid.

- **Brutality** — ▮700
> - An ocean moon with a military bunker.

-  ⍊ ᔑ !¡ 𝙹 ∷ ╎ ⨅ ᔑ ℸ ̣  ╎ 𝙹 リ — ▮???? 
> - DATA CORRUPTED

# __SECTOR: Creevan__ 
- **Eden** — ▮0 
> - 127 Eden, a small subsection of the whole of 127 Eve, consists of two mining outposts deemed Eve-M1 and Eve-M2, respectively. Long ago, around the year 1950, the colonizers of 127 Eve arrived in these areas, eventually going missing only a couple of years later. The outposts that housed mining operations and facilities pose as the basis of the Company’s business here. Collect the scrap from these abandoned outposts and report back to the Company building.

- **Haul** — ▮0 
> - Halden Electronics's former storehouse, all low-level appliances are kept here. Be it air conditioning, toilets, showers, or washing machines. Cruisers line the parking lots.

- **Tunere** — ▮0
> - A very ancient and large moon that can be confused with a gas giant at times due to its sulfur stripes. Once was impacted by a smaller satellite moon, which formed 59 Affliction. Secrets lie here, it is advised to take caution.

- **Rampart** — ▮0
> - A walled city on lockdown for unknown reasons. Take extreme care in exploration.

- **Affliction** — ▮0 
> - Formerly a popular storage facility and shipment port, 59-Affliction was subjected to an infestation of an insect deemed the "hoarding bug", moving many people away. As a last ditch effort to eradicate the infestation, the Company armed a powerful type of explosive and lit the fuse. In the end, this explosive was too powerful and knocked 59-Affliction into a freefall into a larger moon.

- **Atlas Abyss** — ▮200 
> - A moon of dark secrets, jagged terrain, and carved stone. Below the surface, the Masked Men have broken free. The abyss below extends redacted meters, and none have survived the fall.

- **Spectralis** — ▮290 
> - Spectralis stands as a relic of bygone eras, preserving the memories of the departed

- **Zenit** — ▮470
> - Zenit Subterrane was constructed as a refuge from the inhospitable conditions of the moon's surface, a sanctuary for those seeking shelter from the icy wilderness above. Yet, as communication with the surface was lost, the bunker became a tomb, its halls haunted by the ghosts of those who once sought solace within its walls.

- **Ichor** — ▮575
> - A very ancient and large moon that can be confused with a gas giant at times due to its sulfur stripes. Once was impacted by a smaller satellite moon, which formed 59 Affliction. Secrets lie here, it is advised to take caution.

- **Summit** — ▮675
> - After a solar flare activated a mysterious robotic creature deemed the A16-L3, otherwise known as the Old Birds, the English Military wanted to redevelop them for their own goals. 290 Summit, only known as a desolate mountain, was a perfect place to put a research post in the English Military's eyes. Today, the mountainous moon is known for its incredible cold weather and its large amounts of A16-L3. Grab old parts swiftly and make your way back to the Company Building.

- **Feign** — ▮800
> - Halden's prodigy moon, hosting its grand manufacturing products. From cruisers to mechs, Halden specializes in everything electronic, and this is a testament to its strength.

- **Wither** — ▮800
> - Small regions of habitable forest surrounded by mountains and barren deserts. The moon's surface is dotted by bizarre architecture.

- **Attenuation** — ▮0

- **Celest** — ▮350
> - Celest, a moon with a distinct red forest surrounding a vast valley, presents a visually striking but hazardous environment. The designated landing spot is within the valley, providing a relatively sheltered area for operations. However, the red forest's dense foliage and the rugged terrain within the valley demand careful navigation.

- **Volition** — ▮450 
> - Synthesis is an intriguing moon with lush, Earth-like landscapes featuring verdant forests and varied topography. The dynamic terrain includes numerous holes and unstable ground, making exploration treacherous, especially when crossing the perilous, breakable bridge. Adventurers must also contend with diverse enemies, including the formidable Old Bird, while accessing a mysterious facility via an elevator.

- **Argent** — ▮510
> - Argent's history is veiled in mystery, its abandonment a puzzle yet to be solved by those who dare to uncover its secrets.

- **Sanguine** — ▮520
> - Initial scans revealed a seemingly abandoned moon, yet the structures are well-maintained despite that. Technology has a habit of going haywire near these structures (especially GPSs), and as such, explorers seldom visit. The ones that do visit and survive the expeditions have become world famous, including but not limited to Rachel, Melissa, and Samantha.

- **Calamitous** — ▮600 
> - A scorching hot moon, not capable of supporting life, including humans.

- **Celestria** — ▮600 
> - Initially established as a planetary outpost, Celestria served as a military stronghold during an interstellar conflict. Unbeknownst to many, it became a hub for clandestine experiments on harnessing extraterrestrial energies. Survivors recount tales of structures morphing, evolving with an alien intelligence.

- **Boreal** — ▮0 
> - Boreal is a northern terraforming project that was abandoned after all human life on site suddenly vanished.

- **Vacuity** — ▮150
> - Welcome to 35 Vacuity, an exciting new S-ranked moon mod for Lethal Company. This mod introduces a dynamic seasonal system, where Vacuity randomly alternates between a canyon desert or winter moon environment each time you land.

**<details><summary> Click to Expand**

</summary>

# __Threat Level: Low__ 
- **Immortal Snail**
> ![Immortal Snail](https://imgur.com/HGAfk4r.png)
>> The Immortal Snail looks like a regular snail, but it's special because it can't be killed. It has a shiny shell and leaves a slimy trail just like any other snail. No matter what you do to it—smash it, burn it, or squish it—it doesn't die. People have tried to get rid of it, but it just keeps on going, making it a real head-scratcher for everyone.

- **Rats**
> ![Rats](https://i.imgur.com/M6ZASpl.jpeg)
>> Each rat will either defend the nest or scout the dungeon. If a player gets too close to the nest, they will damage the player.

- **Aloe**
> ![Aloe](https://i.imgur.com/VwgDb3E.jpeg)
>> Aloe emerges from the shadows, drawn to weakened players, her hunger growing as their health dwindles.

- **BellCrab**
> ![BellCrab](https://imgur.com/SzBiFLU.png)
>> BellCrab is an unassuming creature that hides among the remnants of bell scrap, its shiny shell reflecting the light as it waits for unsuspecting players. At first glance, its playful demeanor and harmless appearance lure adventurers closer, but once they draw near, BellCrab strikes with surprising speed, dragging them into its metallic lair, where the true danger of this seemingly innocuous crab reveals itself.

- **Peeper**
> ![Peeper](https://imgur.com/dQB1D6u.png)
>> The Peeper are adorable, harmless aliens resembling spherical creatures with endearing features. They waddle around joyfully, their cute appearance captivating those who encounter them. However, their innocence is deceptive; upon contact, they latch onto unsuspecting individuals. Once attached, they gradually make their host feel increasingly heavy, burdening them with an unexplained weight. Despite their playful demeanor, the Peepers' ability to transfer a heavy load upon their victims serves as a dangerous ability, reminding others of the hidden dangers that lurk within their seemingly harmless exterior.

- **Horseshoe Crab**
> ![Horseshoe Crab](https://imgur.com/scac5Nt.png)
>> The horseshoe Crab is a unique land-dwelling creature with an ancient-looking exoskeleton. While it appears harmless as it slowly roams the terrain, stepping on this quirky creature triggers a surprising reaction—it launches the player far into the air! This unexpected boost can provide an exhilarating experience, but caution is advised, as the sudden flight may lead to unpredictable landings. The HorseShoe Crab’s peculiar behavior adds a fun twist to encounters in its habitat.

- **Red Gnome**
> ![Red Gnome](https://i.imgur.com/pNfw47n.jpeg)
>> Gnomes might seem like cute little creatures that hang out in gardens, but they're sneaky. They freeze up when they know you're watching, pretending to be harmless. But the moment you look away, they get mischievous. They can zap you away to who-knows-where in the blink of an eye. So, don't be fooled by their innocent act. If you're not careful, turning your back on them could land you in serious trouble.

- **Blue Gnome**
> ![Blue Gnome](https://i.imgur.com/Q5k5GR4.jpeg)
>> The Blue Gnome isn’t like the others — once it sees you, it chases you no matter what. Staring at it won’t stop it. It runs straight at you with tiny legs and a creepy grin. If it touches you, you or the gnome will teleport… but no one knows where. It’s fast, relentless, and weirdly quiet.

- **Manor Lord**
> ![Manor Lord](https://i.imgur.com/gLUX2tT.jpeg)
>> The Manor Lord Puppeteer is a shadowy enemy in the facility that strikes quickly, stabbing you before disappearing. It leaves behind a puppet linked to you—any damage to the puppet directly hurts you. Protect the puppet to survive while staying vigilant for its next attack.

- **Mantis Shrimps**
> ![Mantis Shrimps](https://imgur.com/CbMHdjo.png)
>> Don't let their small size fool you; these little guys pack a punch! Docile, these inside creatures roam around the facility until a player walks too close. Once a player gets too close, they stop moving and warn the player, and if the player persists in their approach... the player becomes history. They spawn in small groups.

- **Cleaning Drone**
> ![Cleaning Drone](https://imgur.com/yuE2PQg.png)
>> Cleaning drones are small, aerial machines that were built to handle infestation within the facilities. They slowly roam around the building, dispensing a fog of highly concentrated TZP chemicals. The purpose of this fog was to kill invasive insects, however, they seem to have long since grown resistant to it, even using it to their advantage at times as a place to hide. There seems to be no evidence of who made these devices.

- **Moving Turret**
> ![Moving Turret](https://imgur.com/guq5lqG.png)
>> It patrols the halls of the facilities, beaming a red spotlight from the tip of its barrel. It aimlessly roams around until it spots a person. Once it gets within a short range of its target, it stops moving, aims, then starts firing. Thankfully, it’s much weaker in damage and slower to lock on than a normal turret. However, the turret also seems to have a tighter, longer range than its stationary counterpart, able to gun down an entire hallway. It seems to stop attempting to aim once it begins firing, just shooting indiscriminately in that direction. However, still keep your guard up around this thing, for if you underestimate it, your life may come to an end quickly.

- **Redwood Forest Giant**
> ![Redwood Forest Giant](https://imgur.com/M4AfKaM.png)
>> In the depths of the dark forest dwell the mighty Redwood Forest Giants. Towering over the trees, they usually pose no threat. However, be wary of their colossal steps, which could inadvertently kill you.

# __Threat Level: Medium__ 
- **BigMouth**
> ![BigMouth](https://imgur.com/5gbcqbY.png)
>> Be careful; sometimes, an item can hide a monster...

- **SCP-3166**
> ![SCP-3166](https://i.imgur.com/GyoOx3M.jpeg)
>> A monstrous, bloated parody of a cartoon cat, stitched from real fur and filled with hot lasagna. It appears during times of silence—when laughter fades, or nostalgia dies. It hunts those who mock, forget, or abandon what it once was. Gorefield speaks in garbled meows and screeches, force-feeding victims with lasagna torn from its own body. Feeding it may buy time… but it never stops being hungry.

- **BigEyes**
> ![BigEyes](https://i.imgur.com/ZkwJw5b.jpeg)
>> Don't look if he's awake...

- **Bruce The Flying Shark**
> ![Bruce The Flying Shark](https://i.imgur.com/Smo954a.jpeg)
>> Bruce is a docile outside enemy that likes to spawn during the midday. He only attacks players who are injured near him. The more a player is injured, the further away Bruce will be able to smell them. Only one can spawn at once.

- **Roller**
> ![Roller](https://imgur.com/p0J5lCf.png)
>> It's a spiky creature that likes to hide in its shell. From time to time, it will search for any nearby dangers using its big eye. If endangered, it will show its spikes and roll towards threats!

- **Ogopogo**
> ![Ogopogo](https://i.imgur.com/BGpIGkv.jpeg)
>> The Ogopogo are hostile entities reminiscent of Earth's legendary leviathans. They lurk at the bottom of Vow, March, and Adamance's bodies of water, never straying from these depths. When a player ventures too close, they are swiftly targeted and dragged underwater, where the Ogopogo's young, known as Vermin, will begin to feast on them. To effectively counter the Ogopogo, players must either flee immediately upon hearing its warning signal or hold onto an active stun device while being snatched, as these tactics are crucial for survival against this formidable foe.

- **SCP1507** 
> ![SCP1507](https://i.imgur.com/31TfNAw.jpeg)
>> SCP-1507 is the collective designation given to thirty plastic lawn flamingos of unknown make or manufacturer.

> ![Men Stalker](https://i.imgur.com/516nhJX.jpeg)
>> A rare monster with a power level of 3 that can only spawn once per day. It takes the appearance of a tall, slender, rough-looking human. When it finds a player, it will begin to stalk him from a distance while trying to hide from scavengers as much as possible. However, it can be killed, and you can lose it during the stalking phase by running far enough from it.

- **Shy Guy**
> ![Shy Guy](https://imgur.com/GcpBG1u.png)
>> Shy Guy may seem harmless, sitting and crying, but don't be fooled. Even if you glimpse at him for less than a second, he unleashes a piercing scream and charges at you with alarming speed. His sudden transformation from sorrowful to aggressive makes encounters with him terrifying and unpredictable.

- **Faceless Stalker**

- **Football**
> ![Football](https://i.imgur.com/GSLOnoH.jpeg)

- **Haunted Harpist**
> ![Haunted Harpist](https://imgur.com/3FJxMrF.png)
>> The Haunted Harpist is an enemy that initially roams the map while playing its haunting melody on the harp.

- **Phantom Piper**
> ![Phantom Piper](https://imgur.com/mp7uDgl.png)
>> The Phantom Piper plays the bagpipes. Unlike the Haunted Harpist, the Phantom Piper is scared of players and will run away, bagpipes in hand, when provoked. Although, luckily for him, he is always escorted by his Ethereal Enforcers.

- **The Thing**
> ![The Thing](https://imgur.com/chuD2ax.png)
>> The Thing is a creature that lurks in the darkness, observing players quietly and strategically. It doesn’t rush its prey; instead, it follows them subtly, keeping itself hidden and waiting for the right moment. Each time it appears, it’s only a fleeting glimpse—a shadow slipping out of sight, just enough to be noticed and trigger a sense of dread.
The creature has a unique pattern: it watches multiple players, as if it’s studying them, but it only acts after observing a specific number. Once it has its eyes set, The Thing abducts the last player it saw. It doesn’t simply chase them; instead, it pulls them suddenly into a dark, ominous room.
In this room, the abducted player is trapped and must play a game to escape. The rules of this game are unknown at first, and the player has no choice but to play to survive. The Thing watches them the entire time from the shadows, observing each struggle and mistake. If they manage to escape, The Thing releases them, but it leaves a lasting feeling of being watched, as if it may one day return for another game.
The room game is simple, when a player comes into the room, a shovel spawns next to him.
The player need to find and hit with the shovel a certain amount of monster in the room in a certain amount of time. If the time is running out, the monster comes to the player and kills him with a jumpscare.
